JScript 11.0 is a modern scripting language with a wide variety of 
applications. It is a true object-oriented language, and yet it still 
keeps its "scripting" feel. JScript 10.0 maintains full backwards 
compatibility with previous versions of JScript, while incorporating 
great new features and providing access to the common language runtime 
and .NET Framework.
